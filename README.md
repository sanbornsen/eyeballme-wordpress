<p><strong>This is a wordpress plugin for Eyeballme.</strong></p>

<p><strong>1. What does this plugin do?</strong></p>

<p>This plugin basically helps wordpress users to send it&#39;s images automatically to the eyeballme whenever he posts something to his/her wordpress page from the admin panel, and also helps the front end visitors to get the similar dresses showing on that image.</p>

<p><strong>2. How does it work?</strong></p>

<p>When ever you give a post we extract all the image urls from the post then select some of them and store them in our databse. The selection procedure consider only those image has some cloths or some human face in it. Then we add little dom to your frontend, and show a little icon of Vindowshop on those particular images we have selected earlier. Clicking on that icon a modal pops up and show you the similar results.</p>

<p><strong>3. How to use it?</strong></p>

<p><u>Step 1:</u> Download the plugin, it comes in a directory named eyeballme-wordpress, move it to your wordpress plugin directory. i.e. wp-content/plugins/eyeballme-wordpress.</p>

<p><u>Step 2:</u> Just go and grap your appId and apiKey from http://developers.eyeballme.co. Open the file named eyeballme.php and replace $appId with the appId you have got from us and $apiKey with the apiKey. <em>Note: $appId and $apiKey both should be in string format. i.e. if you have got an appId 12322123, then you should write $appId = &#39;12322123&#39;.</em></p>

<p><u>Step 3:</u> Now just install the plugin and forget about it. :) We&#39;ll remind you when to update and where to update.</p>
